# Help-Me

1) An Open Source Web Application which intends to help the society by Connecting People to Hospitals in One click*

2) Users will click on an Emergency button which will then take the user to a form (textbox) where he will fill the details ( for eg:- if there is an accident near the user, then he can send those details).

3) Once the user submits the form, the website will send a notification to all the logged in hospitals which will then Mark the notification as Accepted and send their Emergency services ( such as an Ambulance ) to the location of the user.
